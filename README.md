## MeadCo ScriptX.Print.Client
The MeadCo.ScriptX.Print project brings control of printing to browser based content in all browsers on all devices.
MeadCo.ScriptX.Client.* are the javascript libraries for interfacing between the client devices and the server system
 where-ever that server may be:
* in the cloud
* an on premise server
* services on the device (PC)

We are making the libraries available early in our developments. At this time the server system is only available in
 prototype form in its cloud incarnation but we hope to radiply iterate both server and client code and look forward to 
 comment and/or cooperation from the community.
