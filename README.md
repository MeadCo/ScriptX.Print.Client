## MeadCo ScriptX Service Client Library
The MeadCo ScriptX Services project brings control of printing to browser based content in all browsers on all devices.
These javascript libraries are for interfacing between the client devices and the server system where-ever that server may be:
* [in the cloud](https://scriptxservices.meadroid.com)
* an on premise server
* services on the device (PC)

These libraries are written to provide an emulation of the MeadCo ScriptX Add-on for Internet Explorer on Windows. In combination with the [MeadCoScriptXJS library](https://github.com/MeadCo/MeadCoScriptXJS) the emulation provides 
significant levels of compatibility with in-browser script written for the add-on so allowing the same code to run with both the add-on or services depending on the client device. 

The libraries are used by our extensive set of [samples](https://scriptxprintsamples.meadroid.com). 

They may also be used 'stand-alone' although the code is not very modern doe to the requirement to support older versions of Internet Explorer.
